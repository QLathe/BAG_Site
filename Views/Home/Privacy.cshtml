We provide Third-Party Content as a service to those  interested in such content.

<br><br><h2>
    
12. Disclaimers 
</h2>
Your use of our Services is at your sole risk. Except as otherwise provided in a writing by us,  our Services and any content therein are provided “as is” and “as available” without  warranties of any kind, either express or implied, including, but not limited to, implied  warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, title, and non-infringement.  In addition, Board Artist Group does not represent or warrant that our Services are  accurate, complete, reliable, current, or error-free.

You  assume the entire risk as to the quality and performance of the Services. 
<br><br><h2>
    
13. Limitation of Liability 
</h2>
To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, Board Artist Group and the other Board  Artist Group Parties will not be liable to you under any theory of liability—whether based  in contract, tort, negligence, strict liability, warranty, or otherwise—for any indirect,  consequential, exemplary, incidental, punitive, or special damages or lost profits, even if  Board Artist Group or the other Board Artist Group Parties have been advised of the  possibility of such damages. 
The total liability of Board Artist Group and the other Board Artist Group Parties for any  claim arising out of or relating to these Terms or our Services, regardless of the form of the  action, is limited to the amount paid by you to use our Services. 
The limitations set forth in this Section 13 will not limit or exclude liability for the gross  negligence, fraud, or intentional misconduct of Board Artist Group or the other Board Artist  Group Parties or for any other matters in which liability cannot be excluded or limited under  applicable law. Additionally, some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of  incidental or consequential damages, so the above limitations or exclusions may not apply to  you. 
<br><br><h2>
    
14. Release 
</h2>
To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, you release Board Artist Group and the other  Board Artist Group Parties from responsibility, liability, claims, demands, and/or damages (actual  and consequential) of every kind and nature, known, and unknown (including, but not limited to,  claims of negligence), arising out of or related to disputes between users, and the acts or omissions  of third parties. If you are a consumer who resides in California, you hereby waive your rights  under California Civil Code § 1542, which provides: “A general release does not extend to claims  which the creditor does not know or suspect to exist in his or her favor at the time of executing the  release, which if known by him or her must have materially affected his or her settlement with the  debtor.” 
<br><br>
<h2>
    
15. Transfer and Processing Data 
</h2>
In order for us to provide our Services, you agree that we may process, transfer, and store  information about you in the United States and other countries, where you may not have the same  rights and protections as you do under local law. 
<br><br>
<h2>
16. Dispute Resolution; Binding Arbitration 
</h2>
Please read the following section carefully because it requires you to arbitrate certain  disputes and claims with Board Artist Group and limits the manner in which you can seek  relief from us, unless you opt out of arbitration by following the instructions set forth below.  No class or representative actions or arbitrations are allowed under this arbitration  agreement. In addition, arbitration precludes you from suing in court or having a jury trial.  
No Representative Actions. You and Board Artist Group agree that any dispute arising out of or related to these Terms or our Services is personal to you and Board Artist Group and  that any dispute will be resolved solely through individual action, and will not be brought as  a class arbitration, class action, or any other type of representative proceeding. 
Arbitration of Disputes. Except for small claims disputes in which you or Board Artist Group seeks to bring an individual action in small claims court located in the county of your billing  address or disputes in which you or Board Artist Group seeks injunctive or other equitable relief  for the alleged unlawful use of intellectual property, you and Board Artist Group waive your  rights to a jury trial and to have any dispute arising out of or related to these Terms or our  Services resolved in court. Instead, for any dispute or claim that you have against Board Artist  Group or relating in any way to the Services, you agree to first contact Board Artist Group and  attempt to resolve the claim informally by sending a written notice of your claim (“Notice”) to  Board Artist Group by email at info@boardartistgroup.com or by certified mail addressed to [insert  legal department address]. The Notice must (a) include your name, residence address, email  address, and telephone number; (b) describe the nature and basis of the claim; and (c) set forth the  specific relief sought. Our notice to you will be similar in form to that described above. If you and  Board Artist Group cannot reach an agreement to resolve the claim within thirty (30) days after  such Notice is received, then either party may submit the dispute to binding arbitration  administered by JAMS or, under the limited circumstances set forth above, in court. All disputes  submitted to JAMS will be resolved through confidential, binding arbitration before one arbitrator.  Arbitration proceedings will be held in [county, state] or may be conducted telephonically or via  video conference for disputes alleging damages less than $250,000, in accordance with the JAMS  Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures (“JAMS Rules”). The most recent version of the  JAMS Rules are available on the JAMS website and are hereby incorporated by reference. You  either acknowledge and agree that you have read and understand the JAMS Rules or waive your  opportunity to read the JAMS Rules and waive any claim that the JAMS Rules are unfair or should  not apply for any reason.  
You and Board Artist Group agree that these Terms affect interstate commerce and that the  enforceability of this Section 16 will be substantively and procedurally governed by the Federal  Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. § 1, et seq. (the “FAA”), to the maximum extent permitted by applicable  law. As limited by the FAA, these Terms and the JAMS Rules, the arbitrator will have exclusive


authority to make all procedural and substantive decisions regarding any dispute and to grant any  remedy that would otherwise be available in court, including the power to determine the question  of arbitrability. The arbitrator may conduct only an individual arbitration and may not consolidate  more than one individual’s claims, preside over any type of class or representative proceeding or  preside over any proceeding involving more than one individual.  
The arbitrator, Board Artist Group, and you will maintain the confidentiality of any arbitration  proceedings, judgments and awards, including, but not limited to, all information gathered,  prepared and presented for purposes of the arbitration or related to the dispute(s) therein. The  arbitrator will have the authority to make appropriate rulings to safeguard confidentiality, unless  the law provides to the contrary. The duty of confidentiality does not apply to the extent that  disclosure is necessary to prepare for or conduct the arbitration hearing on the merits, in connection  with a court application for a preliminary remedy or in connection with a judicial challenge to an  arbitration award or its enforcement, or to the extent that disclosure is otherwise required by law  or judicial decision. 
You and Board Artist Group agree that for any arbitration you initiate, you will pay the filing fee  and Board Artist Group will pay the remaining JAMS fees and costs. For any arbitration initiated  by Company, Board Artist Group will pay all JAMS fees and costs. You and Board Artist Group agree that the state or federal courts of the State of California and the United States sitting in Los  Angeles, California have exclusive jurisdiction over any appeals and the enforcement of an  arbitration award.  
Any claim arising out of or related to these Terms or our Services must be filed within one  year after such claim arose; otherwise, the claim is permanently barred, which means that  you and Board Artist Group will not have the right to assert the claim.  
You have the right to opt out of binding arbitration within 30 days of the date you first  accepted the terms of this Section 16 by emailing us at info@boardartistgroup.com. In order  to be effective, the opt-out notice must include your full name and address and clearly indicate  your intent to opt out of binding arbitration. By opting out of binding arbitration, you are agreeing  to resolve disputes in accordance with Section 17. 
If any portion of this Section 16 is found to be unenforceable or unlawful for any reason, (a) the  unenforceable or unlawful provision shall be severed from these Terms; (b) severance of the  unenforceable or unlawful provision shall have no impact whatsoever on the remainder of this  Section 16 or the parties’ ability to compel arbitration of any remaining claims on an individual  basis pursuant to this Section 16; and (c) to the extent that any claims must therefore proceed on a  class, collective, consolidated, or representative basis, such claims must be litigated in a civil court  of competent jurisdiction and not in arbitration, and the parties agree that litigation of those claims  shall be stayed pending the outcome of any individual claims in arbitration. Further, if any part of  this Section 16 is found to prohibit an individual claim seeking public injunctive relief, that  provision will have no effect to the extent such relief is allowed to be sought out of arbitration, and  the remainder of this Section 16 will be enforceable.  
<br><br>
<h2>
17. Governing Law and Venue 
</h2>
Any dispute arising from these Terms and your use of the Services will be governed by and  construed and enforced in accordance with the laws of California, except to the extent preempted  by U.S. federal law, without regard to conflict of law rules or principles (whether of California or  any other jurisdiction) that would cause the application of the laws of any other jurisdiction. Any  dispute between the parties that is not subject to arbitration or cannot be heard in small claims  court will be resolved in the state or federal courts of California and the United States, respectively,  sitting in Los Angeles, California. 
<br><br>

<h2>
18. Modifying and Terminating our Services 
</h2>
We reserve the right to modify our Services or to suspend or stop providing all or portions of our  Services at any time. You also have the right to stop using our Services at any time. We are not  responsible for any loss or harm related to your inability to access or use our Services. 
<br><br>

<h2>
19. Severability 
</h2>
If any provision or part of a provision of these Terms is unlawful, void, or unenforceable, that  provision or part of the provision is deemed severable from these Terms and does not affect the  validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions. 
<br><br>

<h2>
20. Miscellaneous 
</h2>
The failure of Board Artist Group to exercise or enforce any right or provision of these Terms will  not operate as a waiver of such right or provision. The section titles in these Terms are for  convenience only and have no legal or contractual effect. Except as otherwise provided herein,  these Terms are intended solely for the benefit of the parties and are not intended to confer third 
party beneficiary rights upon any other person or entity. You agree that communications and  transactions between us may be conducted electronically. Under California Civil Code Section  1789.3, California consumers are entitled to the following specific consumer rights notice: The  Complaint Assistance Unit of the Division of Consumer Services of the California Department of  Consumer Affairs may be contacted in writing at 1625 N. Market Blvd., Suite N-112, Sacramento,  California 95834, or by telephone at 1 (800) 952-5210.
